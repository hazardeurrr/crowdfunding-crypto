<br></br>(V1) refers to Version 1 of the platform, while <br></br>(V2) refers to Version 2 of the platform.
<br></br><br></br>
You agree that by accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SITE AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.
<br></br><br></br>
BlockBoosted is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial institution, or creditor.

<h2>6. FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGNS & DONATIONS</h2>

<h5>Campaign contract creation</h5>
<p>When you create a campaign, you will interact with our “factory” smart contract. This will create a new instance of our “campaign” smart contract that will be associated with your campaign. We do not have the hand on this smart contract : it is public on the blockchain; has its own address and everyone can interact with it. We provide on our Site an easy way to interact with it.
</p>

<h5>Donating to a campaign</h5>
<p>Users can donate to a campaign interacting with the smart contract associated with it through a dedicated function. They should do so on the Site on the checkout page of the campaign, accessible by the “Back this campaign” button on the campaign’s page, or by selecting any of the reward tier available.
<br></br>Notice that no refund of any kind will be possible on the Site once you have backed the campaign.
<br></br><br></br>
As soon as you participate in a campaign, you consent and agree that your email will be shared with the creator of the campaign to receive eventual rewards from them. Note that this is the only way for the creator to contact you. If you don’t fill your email address on your profile, we will not be responsible nor the creator of the campaign for the non-delivery of the eventual counterparties associated with your donation as there will be no way for us to contact you.
<br></br><br></br>
Every donation/interaction not made through the Site to/with the campaign’s contract may result in an unwanted behavior. We aren’t responsible for any donation/interaction not made through the Site that would not fulfill its purpose.
</p>

<h5>Campaigns display</h5>
<p>Creating an offensive or inappropriate campaign on BlockBoosted app will result in the immediate deletion of the campaign from the platform.
<br></br>Note that each campaign needs to be reviewed by our team before it’s accessible on our platform. If a campaign doesn’t respect these Terms of Use, we reserve ourselves the right to unapprove it. An unapproved campaign will not be displayed on our platform, hence we won’t provide any interface to access its smart-contract, nor show its description, images, or any other related data. Creators will be informed by notification about the status of their campaign.
<br></br>As mentioned throughout theses Terms of Use, an offensive, racist, illegal or sexual related campaign will not be displayed on our platform. BlockBoosted has the right to remove this campaign at any moment if it does not fit the terms and conditions specified.
<br></br><br></br>
Campaigns are ranked & displayed depending on their status and “like score”. Ongoing campaigns will be displayed first, followed by future campaigns and finished campaigns. The “like score” increases each time a user likes a campaign. 
<br></br>(V1) Each user has the same “like” weight.
<br></br>(V2) The weight of the “like” depends on the amount of BBST tokens they possess. The more tokens, the more heavy the “like” is.
</p>

<h5>Campaign realization</h5>
<p>From the end of the campaign, the campaign creator will be able to withdraw the amount raised  - i.e. the balance on the associated smart contract - interacting with it through a dedicated function that can be called on the Site directly on the campaign’s page (“Withdraw” button). 
<br></br>If a platform fee is applicable, it will be taken during the withdrawal process automatically.
<br></br>(V1) We do not take any platform fee.
<br></br>(V2) For campaigns held in BBST, we do not take any fee. Otherwise, a 3.5% platform fee will apply.
<br></br><br></br>
Note that the creator will be able to withdraw the whole balance even though the campaign has not reached its objective.
<br></br><br></br>
From the end of the campaign, the campaign creator undertakes to provide the Counterparties offered to the backers in accordance with the commitment made by the latter when its campaign was put online on the Site. For this purpose, the campaign creator will be able to download a CSV file on the campaign’s page containing necessary information about backers (“Download data” button).
<br></br><br></br>
In the event that the Campaign Holder could not remunerate the backers of the Promised Counterparties, it expressly undertakes to reimburse them in full and accepts that the Company may in no case assist it in this process.
<br></br><br></br>
The Company is not responsible for the actions of Campaign Holders who remain solely responsible for the terms that bind them to the backer.
<br></br><br></br>
The Project Promoters are solely responsible for the collection of Donations that they organize through the intermediation of the Site and any Counterparties that they propose to the backers as part of the Projects presented on the Site. Therefore, any risks involved in the development and execution of a Project, as well as any postponements and cancellations, are fully covered by the creator.
<br></br><br></br>
In the event of cancellation of a Project, the Project Holder shall arrange refunds at its sole discretion and the Company shall not be held responsible for refunds of Donations collected through the Site.
</p>

<h5>
Reward system</h5>
<p>Every donation made through the Site interface to a campaign registers you into the rewards system. Rewards are distributed every week among the users of the Site, according to their donations and limited to a maximum amount per user and per week. We reserve the right to modify at every moment the amount of rewards given per week without prior notification. Note that any donation not made through our UI may not imply a registration in our reward system.
<br></br>Rewards will be given in BBST Token, and balances will be updated at the beginning of every week (UTC timezone).
<br></br>(V1) You won’t be able to claim your rewards in V1, as BBST Token is not issued yet. However, balances will be updated when you make a donation, and you will be able to claim your rewards when V2 launches : rewards will be retroactive.
